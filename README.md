## Libraries used in the app

#### [`react-router`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)

React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with a React application. It keeps the UI and URL in sync. It's used for the routing and navigation in this project.

#### [`node-sass`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass)

Node-sass allows .scss files to be compiled to css fastly and automatically via a connect middleware.

#### [`react-bootstrap`](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

React-Bootstrap replaces the Bootstrap JavaScript. Each component has been built from scratch as a true React component, without unneeded dependencies like jQuery.

#### [`uuid`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)
