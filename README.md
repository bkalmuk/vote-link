React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with a React application. It keeps the UI and URL in sync. It's used for the routing and navigation in this project.

#### [`node-sass`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass)

Node-sass allows .scss files to be compiled to css fastly and automatically via a connect middleware.

#### [`react-bootstrap`](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

React-Bootstrap replaces the Bootstrap JavaScript. Each component has been built from scratch as a true React component, without unneeded dependencies like jQuery.

#### [`uuid`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)

Moment is a library used for parsing and formatting dates. It's used for formatting the timstamp values in the app.

Also, [`sass`](https://sass-lang.com/) has been used for the styling of the app. Sass is a CSS preprocessor, where you can define variables, use functions, make control statements and iterations within a stylesheet.
